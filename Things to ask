Things to ask

2. In app.html how do vendor files get to vendor and how does /js get to /js
3. Explain the vite setup and workflow
4. multiple main tags in the DOM (footer, nav etc)
5. Why are we using stores for header_nav (HeaderStore.js)?
6. snake_case variable and function names eg (Header.svelte) against JS camelCase conventions
7. What is side_menu store for? (HandEvenStore)
8. the beforeUpdate function in layout and ChangeStore in all pages, what for?
9. How come I am not seeing the requests in the network tab?
10. Why main.js keeps downloading even if 304 status
11. In the server tab, bootstrap.min.css.map 404
12. Adding of main.js in the svelte head of +page.js component
13. Why the (app) route grouping?

TODO:
1. Optimize the code for toggling the menu. Use events
2. Do a large refactor to properly format codes
3. Read up on stores value in Sveltekit. It seems you can assign values directly to stores. example $oldPage = 'shop';
4. Move the shop-layout_content div from shop layout into page.
5. Refactor the shop component into components instead of layouts. Then no need to use @ layout of [id] components
6. Remove the (app) route grouping
7. Cart and wishlist should not be under
8. profile should not be a route group. It should be part of the route url
9. The profiule should have a layout for that side nav
10. Remove scss folder from static. In fact purge static folder.
11. Implement a bundle builder to merge the files.
